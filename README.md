# cube
rotating cube

This will generate a colorful rotating cube.

Use Visual Studio and create a console/C++ project.
Add my code after including the changes to the includes for where GLFW and GLEW are located.
Add the file GRAPHICS.H for point and primitve handling.
Also include libraries for GLEW, GLFW and OPENGL32 as well as installing the dll's in Windows system32.

Thank you
